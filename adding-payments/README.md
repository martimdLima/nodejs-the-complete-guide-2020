# Mongoose

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) tool for MongoDB and Node.js. Mongoose regulates association between data, provides schema validation. Mongoose helps in making the connection between an object in code and establishes those objects in MongoDB.

In this module, the Mongoose schema types and their working are explored, more specifically, how to define Schema Types efficiently and apply custom validation in MongoDB data by defining the validation in Mongoose Schema Types using built-in Mongoose validators.
The basic CRUD Operations and Mongoose queries like: create, find, findById, findOne, updateOne, updateMany, findoneandupdate, save, deleteMany, deleteOne will also be explored in order to learn how manage collections and documents in Node.js applications.
